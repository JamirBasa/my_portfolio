We also rode the Super Viking and the roller coaster multiple times in SkyRanch. It was so much fun, especially since the rides were unlimited. If we had more time, we wouldâ€™ve gone on the Super Viking again and again!

						The strawberries surprisingly tasted a bit like guava, and a heartwarming encounter with a cat made the moment even more special â€” though I wasn't able to capture it on camera, they were absolutely adorable. I also tried strawberry taho and strawberry ice cream, which (thankfully!) actually tasted like strawberries â€” at that point, I think I was just overwhelmed with excitement. As for souvenirs, I bought a hat and a bracelet to remember the trip. We also had the chance to visit the Philippine Military Academy and the serene Bell Church, both of which added depth to the experience.         </p>

					The industry tour had been an incredible learning experienceâ€”one that provided us with valuable insights into the tech world and exposed us to a variety of company cultures. We gained practical knowledge about what employers seek and how we can better prepare ourselves for future careers in the field.
					As we boarded our flight home, I found myself reflecting on everything we had learned and the memories we had made. This educational tour wasnâ€™t just about visiting companiesâ€”it was about broadening our perspectives, building lasting connections, and finding renewed inspiration for our future in the tech industry.
					We returned to Zamboanga with a deeper sense of purpose, fresh motivation, and a clearer vision of the path ahead. The experience has equipped me with insights and knowledge that will undoubtedly shape both my academic journey and professional growth.
